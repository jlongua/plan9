geoblocking

I use geoblocking on my mail server...

does China, Russia, Brazil, India... really need to connect to the dnscrypt server?

I do notice connections to port 3000 from China, but no login attempts, don't know what their doing.
I have fail2ban enabled to block these connections for 10 minutes. And block wrong passwords for 24 hours.
Perhaps thats enough.
